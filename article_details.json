        "original_content": "An important step toward a more interoperable \u201cfediverse\u201d \u2014 the broader network of decentralized social media apps likeMastodon,Blueskyand others \u2014 has been achieved. Now, users on decentralized apps like Mastodon, powered by the ActivityPub protocol, and those powered by Bluesky\u2019s AT Protocol, can easily follow people on other networks, see their posts, as well as like, reply and repost them.Those same people will be able to see the others\u2019 posts in return, too.The technology making this possible isBridgy Fed, one of the efforts aimed at connecting the fediverse with the web, Bluesky and, perhaps later, other networks like Nostr.Since the2022 sale of Twitter to Elon Musk, who rebranded the app X, there\u2019s been asurge of interest in decentralized social media. Apps like Mastodon gained a following in the wake of Twitter\u2019s new ownership, as users explored what a network without a centralized authority may look like. Meanwhile, Bluesky \u2014 a startup originally incubated within Twitter \u2014raised a seed roundand grew its network to over5.7 million usersafter launching publiclyearlier this year.Other decentralized social media networks are finding footing of their own, too, like the blockchain-based Farcaster, which just last month closed on $150 million in funding from Paradigm, a16z crypto, Haun Ventures, USV and others.There\u2019s just one problem these networks face in gaining traction against a rival like X or Meta\u2019s Threads: Their users couldn\u2019t talk to each other.Though both Mastodon and Bluesky are decentralized social media efforts, they rely on different underlying protocols. That means a Mastodon user can interact with others who post elsewhere on the fediverse \u2014 that is, other apps that use the olderActivityPubsocial networking protocol. But they couldn\u2019t interact with people who posted on Bluesky, because it uses the newerAT Protocolto operate.Software developerRyan Barretthas been working to address this problem with Bridgy Fed, a social networking bridge that would connect fediverse users to those on Bluesky and vice versa.Though the matter was originallyfraught with debateover the bridge\u2019s planned opt-out nature, Barrett listened to the community feedback and made the bridge opt-in on both sides for the time being.That could shift in the future, however, to becoming opt-out for Bluesky users only. \u201cThe norms and expectations there are somewhat different than in the fediverse,\u201d he told TechCrunch.Bridgy Fed itself soft-launched in mid-April and transitioned to a fulllaunchover the past month. It\u2019s now one of many different efforts to bridge networks in the fediverse, in addition toSasquatch,pinhole,RSS Parrot,mostr.pubandSkyBridge, though many are not as fully bidirectional as Bridgy is.How to use Bridgy FedUsing Bridgy Fed is fairly easy. It only works with public accounts and public posts, for starters, so there\u2019s no concern about your private or followers-only posts being replicated elsewhere.To bridge an account from the fediverse to Bluesky, you simply follow the Mastodon account@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy. The account will follow you back. You\u2019ll then automatically have a new, bridged account available to Bluesky users under your fediverse/Mastodon handle (where the second @ is now a dot) followed by \u201cap.brid.gy.\u201dFor example, if my Mastodon account is@sarahp@mastodon.socialthen my bridged account is@sarahp.mastodon.social.ap.brid.gy.(OK, sure it\u2019s a lot of letters, but itworks!)Image Credits:Bluesky screenshot of bridged accountOn the flip side, if you want to bridge your Bluesky account to the fediverse, then you\u2019ll follow the@ap.brid.gyaccount on Bluesky. Similarly, you\u2019ll then be provided with a bridged version of your Bluesky account in the fediverse. In this case, the format is @[handle]@bsky.brid.gy.So if my Bluesky account is@sarahp@bsky.social,then my bridged account is@sarahp.bsky.social@bsky.brid.gy. It will also be labeled as an \u201cautomated\u201d account on Mastodon, as well, so people know it\u2019s a bridged account.Anything from your Bluesky account that interacts with fediverse users will be bridged, including replies, @-mentions, likes, reports, and, if you have fediverse followers, your own Bluesky posts. The same is true for the reverse.This is different from cross-posting, to be clear, where you post once using software that then publishes it to all your connected accounts. Instead, it\u2019s more like setting up a mirror of your feed on another platform. This could help you reach more people as you\u2019ll be able to engage with people on a different social network.The fediverse-to-Bluesky bridge (and vice versa) are both still in early beta testing, so you will likely come across issues, bugs, downtime and other problems for now.Barrett says he has more plans ahead for Bridgy Fed, too, including the launch of a prompt to make it discoverable. \u201cWhen you try to follow someone who isn\u2019t yet bridged, it will send them a DM to ask them to opt in. I\u2019m waiting on Bluesky\u2019s upcoming OAuth support for that,\u201d he notes.The bridge currently works with fediverse servers likeMastodon,Friendica,Misskey,PeerTube,Hubzillaand others, as well as Blueskyand your own website. Later, it plans to incorporateNostrsupport into its bridge as well \u2014 a decentralized social service now favored by Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey.",

Instead, Bridgy Fed creates a mirrored feed, potentially reaching a wider audience.\n\n**While currently in beta testing,** Bridgy Fed is one of several efforts aiming to connect fediverse networks. It is expected to incorporate support for Nostr, a decentralized social service favored by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.\n\n**How to Use Bridgy Fed:**\n\n* **Fediverse to Bluesky:** Follow the Mastodon account @bsky.brid.gy.\n* **Bluesky to Fediverse:** Follow the @ap.brid.gy account on Bluesky.\n\n**Bridgy Fed represents a significant step forward in bridging the gap between decentralized social media platforms.** It offers a promising solution for building a more interconnected and interoperable fediverse, allowing users to freely connect and engage regardless of the platform they use. \n"

The two cities mark Zoox\u2019s fourth and fifth test cities, followingLas Vegas,San Franciscoand Seattle.The news comes as federal regulators increase their scrutiny of self-driving car companies likeWaymoand Zoox, both of which are under investigation over safety issues. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationrequested more information from Zooxto aid its probe into rear-end crash risks posed by unexpected braking.That heightened scrutiny \u2014 fueled in part by aCruise incidentlast year involving a pedestrian collision \u2014 might be part of the reason Zoox has been taking a slow and steady approach to testing and scaling.A Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company began mapping the cities this spring. Over the summer, Zoox will deploy its retrofitted Toyota Highlander test fleet with safety drivers behind the wheel \u201cin small areas near the business and entertainment districts.\u201d The company did not say how many test vehicles it would send to each city.Zoox also didn\u2019t say when it aims to remove the safety driver or begin commercial operations in Austin or Miami. Rather, the company is focused on using the different urban environments to fine-tune its autonomous system. For example, Austin has horizontal traffic lights, traffic lights hanging on wires, railway crossings and epic thunderstorms. Miami\u2019s traffic lights are suspended diagonally across intersections and, apparently, the city is plagued withimpatient driversafflicted by road rage.Zoox\u2019s testing protocol is twofold: The company identifies specific pre-planned routes that offer challenging driving features and scenarios, while also randomly testing certain point-to-point routes within a defined geofence.\u201cWe always start with a focused testing area, expanding methodically as our AI gets more familiar with the unique conditions in each city,\u201d reads the blog post.The plans to test in Austin and Miami come as Zoox gears up for its first commercial launch. Zoox has apermitto test its vehicles without a safety driver in parts of San Francisco and Foster City, and is targeting that market as one of its first launch cities alongside Las Vegas.Zoox did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for a timeline for commercial deployment or to provide definitions of the geofenced areas.Zoox has become associated with images of itspurpose-built robotaxi, that cute, breadbox-shaped vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals and side doors that slide open to admit passengers. The company won\u2019t be testing those vehicles on public roads in Austin or Miami, just yet.Zoox has begun limited testing of the fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Las Vegas and Foster City and plans to start offering rides to passengers this year. In February, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) granted Zoox its driverless AV pilot permit, which allows the company to carry members of the public for free within the bounds of its approved Foster City domain. Zoox has not confirmed if it has begun doing that.Zoox\u2019s expansion news comes as the robotaxi space gets a second wind. Or maybe it\u2019s a third wind. GM\u2019s Cruise has also recently announced plans totest its robotaxis in Dallas and Phoenix. Alphabet\u2019s Waymo earlier this year began offeringdriverless rides to employeesin Austin in preparation for aplanned commercial launchthis year, and the company also recently announced plans to begin robotaxi testing inAtlanta.",

        "original_content": "It\u2019s not just instant-delivery startups that arestruggling.Oda, the Norway-based online supermarket delivery startup, has confirmed layoffs of 150 jobs as it drastically scales back its expansion ambitions to focus on just two markets, its homebase and Sweden, the homebase of Mathem, an online grocery that Odamerged withlast year.Oda, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and was once valued as high as $900 million in a round led by SoftBank in its Vision Fund investment heyday,now saysits aim is to become profitable in the two countries sometime next year.Oda\u2019s retreat mirrors what we\u2019ve seen play out in the instant grocery delivery space, where a number of startups have either sold down or been acquired for pennies on each dollar raised as they have struggled to get the unit economics to work amid sluggish growth. That all appeared to come to a major head in April, when Getir, the startup out of Turkey that raised $2.3 billion,announcedlayoffs and a retreat to its home market in pursuit of getting out of the red.\u201cGrocery is the largest category in retail, but even the most capable organizations in the world have struggled to find an online model that works. Online grocery is hard \u2014 complex orders with perishable items and a multi-temperature supply chain in a highly price sensitive category,\u201d Oda\u2019s CEO, Chris Poad,wroteon LinkedIn last week (before the layoffs were announced).Poad\u2019s very presence at the company is part of its efforts to get out of that \u201cstruggle\u201d.With past experience at Amazon, Tesco and Google, Poad only joined the company in April himself, taking over from co-founder Karl Munthe-Kaas. Munthe-Kaas, meanwhile, left after he was reportedly asked by the board to step aside due to what Norwegian mediadescribedas Oda\u2019s \u201cforeign fiasco.\u201dIn short, Oda, riding on hundreds of millions in funding and the pandemic boom for online grocery delivery, had big ambitions to scale across the Nordics and northern Europe. But in 2023, the company announced plans toend its retail operations in Finlandafter just one year; Germany soonfollowed.Oda may have been retrenching its own-brand expansions, but it was also consolidating with other, existing grocery retailers: its merger with Sweden\u2019s Mathem came later in 2023 \u2013 a deal that Oda claimed would make it the largest online grocery retailer in the Nordics with\u201cover NOK 5 billion\u201d($471 million) in revenue.Now, Oda\u2019s confirmed its international expansion strategy is postponed.The company\u2019s state of affairs is a stark reminder of both the exuberance of investors pre-2022, as well as the difficulties that have followed as startups failed to meet growth projections.Prior to the pandemic, Oda \u2013 founded in 2013 \u2013 carved out a place for itself as one of the strong regional players in online grocery delivery in Europe. (Others include Ocado out of the U.K., Rohlik in the Czech Republic, Picnic in the Netherlands and Everli in Italy.)Cue the pandemic and a massive surge of online shopping as people sheltered in place. By2021, SoftBank, via its Vision Fund, led a $265 million round for the company at a valuation of $900 million. But bylate 2022Oda was raising $151 million at a valuation of $353 million.Now, based on recentfinancial reportingfrom Kinnevik, its largest shareholder, the company\u2019s pre-layoffs value would have been just SEK 2.56 billion, or $245 million.Oda, the Norwegian grocery delivery startup, raises a fresh $151M, but at a lowered valuation of $353MLayoffs are often one of the signals not just of a company looking to cut costs, but sometimes of one looking to firm up its balance sheet ahead of a fundraise. And that\u2019s what it looks like Oda is trying to do now, based on onereport. Local publication e24 says Kinnevik and other existing backers Summa Equity and Verdane are expected to provide the bulk of the NOK600 million\u00a0 ($57 million) Oda is reportedly raising. It is unclear what that will translate to in terms of valuation given the other developments.",

        "original_content": "Hiya, folks, and welcome to TechCrunch\u2019s inaugural AI newsletter. It\u2019s truly a thrill to type those words \u2014 this one\u2019s been long in the making, and we\u2019re excited to finally share it with you.With the launch of TC\u2019s AI newsletter, we\u2019re sunsetting This Week in AI, the semiregular column previously known as Perceptron. But you\u2019ll find all the analysis we brought to This Week in AIand more, including a spotlight on noteworthy new AI models, right here.This week in AI, trouble\u2019s brewing \u2014 again \u2014 for OpenAI.A group of former OpenAI employeesspokewith The New York Times\u2019 Kevin Roose about what they perceive as egregious safety failings within the organization. They \u2014 like others who\u2019ve left OpenAI in recent months \u2014 claim that the company isn\u2019t doing enough to prevent its AI systems from becoming potentially dangerous and accuse OpenAI of employing hardball tactics to attempt to prevent workers from sounding the alarm.The group published an open letter on Tuesday calling for leading AI companies, including OpenAI, to establish greater transparency and more protections for whistleblowers. \u201cSo long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public,\u201d the letter reads.Call me pessimistic, but I expect the ex-staffers\u2019 calls will fall on deaf ears. It\u2019s tough to imagine a scenario in which AI companies not only agree to \u201csupport a culture of open criticism,\u201d as the undersigned recommend, but also opt not to enforce nondisparagement clauses or retaliate against current staff who choose to speak out.Consider that OpenAI\u2019s safety commission, which the company recently created in response toinitialcriticism of its safety practices, is staffed with all company insiders \u2014 including CEO Sam Altman. And consider that Altman, who at one point claimed to have no knowledge of OpenAI\u2019s restrictive nondisparagement agreements,himselfsignedthe incorporation documents establishing them.Sure, things at OpenAI could turn around tomorrow \u2014 but I\u2019m not holding my breath. And even if they did, it\u2019d be tough to trust it.NewsAI apocalypse:OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT \u2014 along with Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Google\u2019s Gemini and Perplexity \u2014 allwent downthis morning at roughly the same time. All the services have since been restored, but the cause of their downtime remains unclear.OpenAI exploring fusion:OpenAI is in talks with fusion startup Helion Energy about a deal in which the AI company would buy vast quantities of electricity from Helion to provide power for its data centers, according to the Wall Street Journal. Altman has a $375 million stake in Helion and sits on the company\u2019s board of directors, but he reportedly has recused himself from the deal talks.The cost of training data:TechCrunch takes a look at the pricey data licensing deals that are becoming commonplace in the AI industry \u2014 deals that threaten to make AI research untenable for smaller organizations and academic institutions.Hateful music generators:Malicious actors are abusing AI-powered music generators to create homophobic, racist and propagandistic songs \u2014 and publishing guides instructing others how to do so as well.Cash for Cohere:Reuters reports that Cohere, an enterprise-focused generative AI startup, has raised $450 million from Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures, Cisco and others in a new tranche that values Cohere at $5 billion. Sources familiar tell TechCrunch that Oracle and Thomvest Ventures \u2014 both returning investors \u2014 also participated in the round, which was left open.Research paper of the weekIn aresearch paperfrom 2023 titled \u201cLet\u2019s Verify Step by Step\u201d that OpenAIrecently highlightedon its official blog, scientists at OpenAI claimed to have fine-tuned the startup\u2019s general-purpose generative AI model, GPT-4, to achieve better-than-expected performance in solving math problems. The approach could lead to generative models less prone to going off the rails, the co-authors of the paper say \u2014 but they point out several caveats.In the paper, the co-authors detail how they trained reward models to detect hallucinations, or instances where GPT-4 got its facts and/or answers to math problems wrong. (Reward models are specialized models to evaluate the outputs of AI models, in this case math-related outputs from GPT-4.) The reward models \u201crewarded\u201d GPT-4 each time it got a step of a math problem right, an approach the researchers refer to as \u201cprocess supervision.\u201dThe researchers say that process supervision improved GPT-4\u2019s math problem accuracy compared to previous techniques of \u201crewarding\u201d models \u2014 at least in their benchmark tests. They admit it\u2019s not perfect, however; GPT-4 still got problem steps wrong. And it\u2019s unclear how the form of process supervision the researchers explored might generalize beyond the math domain.Model of the weekForecasting the weather may not feel like a science (at least when you get rained on, like I just did), but that\u2019s because it\u2019s all about probabilities, not certainties. And what better way to calculate probabilities than a probabilistic model? We\u2019ve already seen AI put to work on weather prediction at time scalesfrom hours to centuries, and now Microsoft is getting in on the fun.\u00a0The company\u2019snew Aurora modelmoves the ball forward in this fast-evolving corner of the AI world, providing globe-level predictions at ~0.1\u00b0 resolution (think on the order of 10 km square).Image Credits:MicrosoftTrained on over a million hours of weather and climate simulations (not real weather? Hmm\u2026) and fine-tuned on a number of desirable tasks,Auroraoutperforms traditional numerical prediction systems by several orders of magnitude. More impressively, it beats Google DeepMind\u2019s GraphCast at its own game (though Microsoft picked the field), providing more accurate guesses of weather conditions on the one- to five-day scale.Companies like Google and Microsoft have a horse in the race, of course, both vying for your online attention by trying to offer the most personalized web and search experience. Accurate, efficient first-party weather forecasts are going to be an important part of that, at least until we stop going outside.Grab bagIn a thoughtpiece last month in Palladium, Avital Balwit, chief of staff at AI startup Anthropic, posits that the next three years might be the last she and many knowledge workers have to work thanks to generative AI\u2019s rapid advancements. This should come as a comfort rather than a reason to fear, she says, because it could \u201c[lead to] a world where people have their material needs met but also have no need to work.\u201d\u201cA renowned AI researcher once told me that he is practicing for [this inflection point] by taking up activities that he is not particularly good at: jiu-jitsu, surfing, and so on, and savoring the doing even without excellence,\u201d Balwit writes. \u201cThis is how we can prepare for our future where we will have to do things from joy rather than need, where we will no longer be the best at them, but will still have to choose how to fill our days.\u201dThat\u2019s certainly the glass-half-full view \u2014 but one I can\u2019t say I share.Should generative AI replace most knowledge workers within three years (which seems unrealistic to me given AI\u2019s many unsolved technical problems), economic collapse could well ensue. Knowledge workers make uplarge portions of the workforce and tend to be high earners\u2014 and thus big spenders. They drive the wheels of capitalism forward.Balwit makes references to universal basic income and other large-scale social safety net programs. But I don\u2019t have a lot of faith that countries like the U.S., which can\u2019t even manage basic federal-level AI legislation, will adopt universal basic income schemes anytime soon.With any luck, I\u2019m wrong.",

She\u2019s like Steve from Blues Clues for the next generation \u2013 instead of a network TV show, she hasa YouTube channelwith 10 million subscribers.Ms. Rachel \u2013 a music teacher named Rachel Accurso \u2013 decided to use her platform for good. She set up a fundraiser for Save the Children\u2019s Emergency Fund, which supports children in Gaza, Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and other embattled areas. She called the initiative \u201cMessages for Littles to Help Littles,\u201d and the idea was simple: she would sell500 Cameo videosat $100 a pop, then donate all of the money. She sold out fast, then put requests on hold while she caught up with the backlog of 500 personalized videos.But on Cameo, if a creator doesn\u2019t fulfill their video requests within seven days, then the person who purchased the video gets a refund. And for a full-time content creator and graduate student in early childhood education, that\u2019s not much time to record 500 personalized videos. If reputable creators like Ms. Rachel can\u2019t have time to fulfill a sudden burst of requests, then is Cameo even an effective platform for fundraising?One parent, who reached out to TechCrunch, noted that he was refunded with a Cameo credit; this was especially frustrating because he only bought the Cameo because he thought the money would be going to charity.But Cameo says that due to Apple\u2019s policies, any purchase made as an in-app purchase on an Apple device can only be refunded as a credit.\u201cRecently, we have encountered an unprecedented demand for Ms. Rachel\u2019s Cameo requests, which led to some concerns regarding bookings made through our app,\u201d said Cameo CEO Steven Galanis in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cAs all purchases made through the iOS app are processed directly by Apple, Cameo does not have access to issue refunds. If you prefer a refund over Cameo credits, you canrequest it from Apple directly.\u201dWhen TechCrunch reached out to Ms. Rachel\u2019s management for comment, they contacted Cameo to rectify the situation. Because of this intervention, all parents who donated to this fundraiser should be getting those personalized videos for their kids. But even though Ms. Rachel and her team were not aware of Cameo\u2019s seven-day fulfillment policy, the confusion could cause reputational harm among parents who were frustrated to receive Cameo credits, rather than confirmation of their charitable donations.Cameo\u2019s policy makes sense in some cases \u2013 if a celebrity is inactive on Cameo and someone pays for a video that they never receive, they should be reimbursed. However, Cameo was aware of Ms. Rachel\u2019s highly popular fundraiser, since Cameoposted about it on X. Often, creator platforms like Patreon, Twitch or TikTok will cultivate direct relationships with its most popular talent, keeping a closer eye on these high-priority users. Given that Ms Rachel intended to fulfill her Cameo requests, it\u2019s unclear why Cameo didn\u2019t grant her additional time to do so in the first place, rather than refunding buyers.\u201cBottom line? Cameo wasn\u2019t prepared for the demand and Rachel\u2019s stardom,\u201d a parent who bought a Cameo told TechCrunch. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t f\u2014 with toddler parents.\u201d",

        "original_content": "Animating a 3D character from scratch is generally both laborious and expensive, requiring the use of complex software and motion capture tools.Cartwheelwants to make basic animations as simple as describing them, generating a basic movement with AI and letting creators focus on more expressive tasks.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a lot of new stuff in animation since I started doing it,\u201d said Jonathan Jarvis, co-founder and CEO of the startup and an animator himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a big \u2018blank screen\u2019 problem, where there\u2019s a million buttons and options. Sometimes you\u2019ll spend hours working on something before you even see what it looks like.\u201dCartwheel is intended to skip that first step, going from zero to basic movement, so animators who want to create a scene or character don\u2019t have to spend so much time on elementary motions like taking a step, swatting a fly or sitting down.\u201cWe help generate a motion you would get from a motion capture setup, or keying it [i.e. animating via keyframe] yourself, just a lot faster. There\u2019s a lot of value in just quickly getting it out of your head and moving. Then you can take it and tweak it,\u201d Jarvis said.The interface is deliberately simple, just a character and a text box. You can write just about anything in there, and in a minute or two you\u2019ll have a basic but fluid animation that you can then export to any normal 3D editing suite.You can also check out live 3D examples on their site, likethis boxing oneor a little dudedoing a solo waltz.The model they built is totally original, said co-founder Andrew Carr, also the company\u2019s chief scientist.\u201cWe have multiple data sources, all ethically sourced, and our own labelers labeling these motions,\u201d he explained. \u201cMotion is represented as a matrix \u2014 this is well-known in the literature \u2014 a matrix with poses, time, velocity and so on. So you associate the motion matrix with a text description of the motion, and do pretty standard training on motion-language pairs, the same way you\u2019d generate images or video.\u201dImage Credits:CartwheelThe animations you get are \u201con average about 80% of the way there,\u201d Carr estimated. Jarvis said it can produce impressive, professional-level results, \u201cand sometimes it\u2019s a miss.\u201d But it\u2019s immensely faster and simpler than a traditional animation workflow, especially in environments where you have multiple artists working on one process and even small tweaks have to go up and down the line.The models they use aren\u2019t even that big, meaning they\u2019re cheaper to run and could conceivably be locally hosted.\u201cActually, this is really cool,\u201d Carr said. \u201cFor a video model, you\u2019re predicting 2,000\u00d72,000 pixels, every frame for 60 frames per second \u2026 that\u2019s just such a massive thing it has to wrangle. What we\u2019re predicting is an order of magnitude or more smaller; it can run on the CPU, or older GPUs, and we can train models faster.\u201dCartwheel co-founders Jonathan Jarvis (left) and Andrew Carr.Image Credits:CartwheelJarvis even suggested they might eventually be able to render new or modified animations on the fly, a holy grail for interactivity in games, where characters are generally limited to a set of canned movements and dialogue lines. Things like camera movements and angles can also be intuitively described, and non-human characters are in the pipe as well \u2014 though the startup is first focused on human animations, since they\u2019re by far the most commonly required.It\u2019s reminiscent in a way of how Wonder Dynamics greatly simplified the process of 3D character insertion, with a focus not on replacing animators or artists but on skipping the repetitive drudgery of elementary animation work. The industry as a whole has embraced AI-adjacent tools as time savers that let their creatives focus more on creation; certainly Autodesk has, at any rate, as shown by itsacquisition of Wonder Dynamicstwo weeks ago.It may be a little unseemly to speculate about the ultimate fate of a startup right as it\u2019s starting up, but Cartwheel could conceivably go the same way: snapped up as a promising and powerful feature that could prove an advantage over competitors. But it could also build itself up as an platform-agnostic tool and offer a growing suite of services to professional animators.Either way, it has secured its first round of funding, a $5.6 million seed led by by Accel, with participation by Khosla Ventures, Human Ventures, Heretic VC, MVP Ventures, Correlation Ventures, and Pelion VC \u2014 and a handful of angels, as is tradition.For now Cartwheel is happy to act as one of the many prosumer type apps that animators rely on to do their work. You can test it yourself if yousign up for the beta.\u201cThere\u2019s this notion of AI replacing creative work, and as someone who does creative work, it\u2019s like, no! This leads to more animation, more motion, one person doing more,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cAnd that will eventually go up the stack to the big studios that will be doing incredible stuff we haven\u2019t even thought of. But between the Pixars and the people playing on their phones, there\u2019s a whole bunch of levels, and that\u2019s where a lot of the creative work really gets done.\u201d",
        "paraphrased_content": "## Cartwheel: Simplifying 3D Animation with AI\n\n**Problem:** Animating 3D characters from scratch is time-consuming and expensive, requiring specialized software and motion capture tools. Traditional animation workflows often involve hours spent on basic movements before even seeing the results.\n\n**Solution:** Cartwheel uses AI to generate basic animations from simple text descriptions. This allows animators to focus on more creative tasks instead of spending time on repetitive, elementary motions.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* Users describe desired movements in a text box.\n* Cartwheel's AI generates a basic, fluid animation within a minute or two.\n* The resulting animation can be exported to any standard 3D editing software.\n* Cartwheel uses its own original data sources and models, trained on motion-language pairs.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* **Faster animation:** Generates basic movements significantly quicker than traditional methods.\n* **Simplified workflow:** Eliminates the need for complex software and motion capture setups.\n* **Intuitive interface:** Simple and easy to use, allowing for quick prototyping and experimentation.\n* **Versatile application:** Can be used for a wide range of animation tasks, including human characters, camera movements, and non-human creatures.\n* **Cost-effective:** Models are relatively small and can run on standard hardware, making it accessible to creators of all levels.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n* Cartwheel aims to make animation more accessible to a wider range of creators, allowing them to focus on creative expression.\n* The technology could eventually revolutionize interactive experiences in games and other platforms.\n* Similar to other AI-powered tools, Cartwheel is anticipated to be a valuable asset for the animation industry, complementing traditional methods.\n\n**Funding:** Cartwheel has secured $5.6 million in seed funding from investors including Accel, Khosla Ventures, and Human Ventures.\n\n**The future:** Cartwheel could be acquired by a larger company or evolve into a platform-agnostic tool, offering a wide range of services to professional animators. \n\n**Overall:** Cartwheel is a promising new tool that aims to democratize 3D animation by simplifying the process and empowering creators to focus on artistic expression. The technology has the potential to accelerate the animation industry and drive innovation across various fields.\n"

        "original_content": "Since its launch in 2017,ClickUphas become a popular andwell-fundedproductivity tool. And like all productivity tools, the ClickUp team has also heard the siren song of artificial intelligence. The company has now launched what it calls \u201cClickUp Knowledge Management,\u201d which combines a new wiki-like editor and with a new AI system that can also bring in data from Google Drive, Dropbox, Confluence, Figma and other sources. With that, the company aims to build a tool that can rival other popular services like Notion and Atlassian\u2019s Confluence.ClickUp co-founder and CEO Zeb Evans told me that he believes that AI is critical for knowledge management, but to get the most out of that, businesses need a central repository for all of that knowledge.Image Credits:ClickUp\u201cIn the majority of companies, you have your actual knowledge, that\u2019s written in a certain place like a Confluence [wiki] or Notion,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you have a lot of knowledge in different places. There are some startups like Glean that are starting to connect the dots between that, but the real problem that exists now is that you can go to one tool and kind of connect the dots, but you can\u2019t actually edit and manage those dots and do the work about the work on that same platform.\u201dThat\u2019s a problem the ClickUp team itself faced over the years. And while you could already author documents on the platform, the team decided to build a new product from the ground up that starts with a wiki at its core (and one that feels more like Notion than Confluence) but then also integrates with a new AI system that can pull in data from all of these other sources.\u201cYou can build wikis in ClickUp, but we also now connect to all of your other work tools and aggregate the knowledge in one central company brain, so to speak, where you can write wikis based on all of the context that\u2019s available to you today,\u201d Evans said.The result, ClickUp argues, is a system that brings together the best of Notion, Confluence and Glean to allow users to quickly create documents. For texts like project reports, team updates, summaries and standups, the team already created pre-built templates. Users can also utilize the system to automatically assign tasks, populate task data and find duplicate tasks.There is, of course, also a chatbot that people can use to query their documents. What\u2019s nifty here, though, is that ClickUp has built the system in a way that not only cites all of its sources but also proactively asks the user if it should create relevant documents for them based on the query results.Image Credits:ClickUpEvans stressed that the system takes an employee\u2019s existing access permissions into account, so the AI will only surface information that a given user is allowed to work with.About two years ago, ClickUpacquired Slapdash, a universal search tool that brought together data from what are traditionally siloed SaaS apps. Since then, ClickUp worked on rebuilding the Slapdash architecture so that it could work with AI. This now enables the ClickUp Knowledge Management to perform retrieval augmented generation (RAG) \u2014 which has quickly become the industry standard for augmenting large language models (LLMs) with additional and up-to-date information.\u201cIt\u2019s not a surface-level integration, where with a lot of these things, they use an API to go search all the things. Instead, we are actually digesting all of your databases from your connected applications so we can do a lot of cool stuff with that,\u201d Evans said.Looking ahead, ClickUp aims to use this new system to reduce the amount of work about work even more.\u201cOur big thing for this next release is killing work about work. I hate work about work. I hate having to go ask a bunch of questions and figure out where things are and figure out what people are working on. Every company right now, if you calculate how much time is spent on just writing a standup every single day. \u2018This is what I did today. This is what I did yesterday.\u2019 It\u2019s insane,\u201d said Evans.",
        "paraphrased_content": "## ClickUp Launches AI-Powered Knowledge Management Tool\n\nClickUp, a popular productivity platform, has introduced \"ClickUp Knowledge Management,\" a new tool aimed at streamlining knowledge management within organizations.

        "original_content": "New York City, home to over 60,000 gig delivery workers, has been cracking down on cheap, uncertified e-bikes that have resulted inbattery firesacross the city.Some e-bike providers may see such regulations as a problem for business. But e-bike subscription startupWhizzsees it as an opportunity.\u201cI think the market is moving from a Wild West to a mature market,\u201d Mike Peregudov, CEO and co-founder at Whizz, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to be here in this moment because after all the regulations happen, it will be very hard to enter this market.\u201dThe New York-based startup claims to offer gig workers access to safe, high-quality e-bikes for between $139 and $149 per month. Couriers for Grubhub and DoorDash, Whizz\u2019s official partners in NYC, can access subscriptions and rent-to-own schemes for 15% off. Subscriptions include service, maintenance, anti-theft protection and more.Founded in 2022, Whizz this week raised $12 million to build more e-bikes, begin producing e-mopeds and expand beyond New York to other cities, including Boston, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. The round was broken into $5 million in equity led by Leta Capital and $7 million in debt from Flashpoint VC.Ultimately, Whizz wants to launch nationwide. In the short-term, the startup aims to manage 40,000 e-bikes in the NYC area over the next three years, up from the 2,500 e-bikes Whizz currently has deployed across NYC and Jersey City.There are few players in the e-bike subscription space in the U.S. Whizz\u2019s main competitor isZoomo, an Australian startup with a presence in NYC and a handful of European cities. Zoomo\u2019s subscription costs, on average, are about $49 per week or just under $200 per month.Uber Eats couriersget a better deal at $24 per week, or just under $100 per month. Zoomo also works with enterprise customers to provide entire fleets.The lack of disruption in the e-bike subscription arena could mean that Whizz is in a perfect position to get a first-mover advantage. Or it could mean that the e-bike subscription model is difficult to get right.Other consumer-facingmicromobility subscriptionsin NYC have come and gone, likeBeyond\u2019s e-scooter rental offeringand charging infrastructure company Revel\u2019s attempt atan e-bike subscription. And as we\u2019ve seen from the many failures of shared micromobility companies likeBirdandSuperpedestrian, hardware-as-a-service (HaaS) is a high-capital expenditure business. That doesn\u2019t always square up to the most attractive aspect of subscriptions: an affordable price point. The combination of the two opposing forces often translates to unimpressive margins.On the other hand, subscriptions have the benefit of repeat revenue, which can be leveraged to improve margins as long as a company keeps operations lean and efficient.Whizz says this is where it can shine. The startup has relied on its proprietary software that streamlines operations and a culture of bootstrapping to grow 3.5x year-over-year and reach an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $8 million as of May. ARR is a projection of revenue for the year based on current and expected customer numbers.Peregudov also says Whizz will be EBITDA positive in two to three months and fully profitable within nine months.The CEO and his co-founders all came to New York from Russia a few years ago after founding and selling subscription-based businesses. Peregudov built Partiya Edy, a meal-kit delivery service, andsold it to Yandexin 2019 for $25 million. His co-founders \u2014 Alex Mironov,\u00a0Ksenia Proka, and Artem Serbovka \u2014 built and sold an e-bike subscription platform, Moy Device, to a private equity firm in Russia.\u201cWe never raised hundreds of millions, and I think in this type of business, that could be dangerous,\u201d\u00a0 Peregudov said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen companies that have raised $100 million and then they try to blitzscale. This business is not about blitzscaling.\u201dUsing software to improve unit economicsWhizz\u2019s software manages the back end to help the e-bike subscription startup achieve strong unit economics.Image Credits:WhizzPeregudov says the most important part of Whizz\u2019s business is its proprietary \u201centerprise resource management\u201d (ERP) system, the software that powers the back end and protects Whizz\u2019s assets. The CEO says this software helps Whizz cut costs by 35%, achieve a 85% fleet utilization rate and \u201cimprove margins at every step.\u201dThe software provides analytics on everything from how much time it takes to complete a repair to how IoT can help manage warehouse logistics, from information on all bikes and customers in the system to revenue and payments management. Whizz\u2019s system can even remotely control parts of the bikes to brick them if they get stolen.Another aspect of Whizz\u2019s software is its internal scoring model, which the startup uses to ensure it\u2019s renting bikes to responsible people. \u201cThis scoring system is AI-enabled with more than 50 parameters, and it\u2019s like a bank credit score,\u201d Peregudov said. \u201cThese guys are mostly immigrants, and we are probably the only company on the market that can score them because banks don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s why these guys don\u2019t have credit scores. Our bikes are often the only option for affordable transportation for them.\u201dQuality e-bikes, batteries and serviceWhizz co-founders (left to right): Alex Mironov, Artem Serbovka, Ksenia Proka, and Mike PeregudovImage Credits:WhizzWhizz\u2019s e-bikes are also designed in-house specifically to service food delivery workers. Peregudov claims the bikes are reliable enough to ride for up to 1,000 miles per month and have large batteries to enable couriers to drive more, and thus, earn more. The batteries, he says, are UL certified and built with Samsung cells.Gig workers in NYC can visit one of Whizz\u2019s five hubs to pick up bikes and have them repaired or replaced in 30 minutes or less. The hubs are located in Midtown, Union Square, Harlem and Brooklyn, with a fifth coming this week to Jersey City.Whizz also says it offers customer service in six languages: English, Spanish, French, Turkish, Arabic and Russian.The major snag in Whizz\u2019s future plans is the fact that its bikes and batteries are all assembled in China. The Biden administration recently announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, including e-bikes and batteries, which will be subject to a25% price hike.Peregudov says he\u2019s not worried because Whizz owns its IP and can move production to a new partner in India or Vietnam.Can Whizz\u2019s model scale across the U.S.?While the e-bike subscription market geared at gig delivery workers is still new, it\u2019s not a guarantee that Whizz will be able to scale in the U.S. Zoomo, the incumbent, as it were, has a respectable presence in Europe, but its market share in the U.S. has recently shrunk. The startup used to offer its services in San Francisco, but shuttered there in 2022. Zoomo did not respond to TechCrunch to explain what went wrong.Whizz\u2019s strategy for expansion is twofold: Work its way down the East Coast before expanding nationally, and offer new form factors to reach a broader range of delivery workers.Whizz\u2019s latest funding round will help get the company part of the way by taking more territory in NYC and building a new e-moped. In the long run, the startup sees itself even potentially bringing EVs onto the platform for delivery workers who don\u2019t live in bike-friendly cities, which are few and far between in the U.S.Sergey Toporov, a partner at Leta Capital who led Whizz\u2019s equity round, said he invested in the startup because it was able to achieve a great contribution margin on a small scale.Toporov noted that Leta mainly invests in software companies, so Whizz\u2019s ERP system is what appealed the most because it will help the company stay efficient and organized as it scales its fleet, customers and employee base and brings on new types of vehicles.\u201cThe hype around micromobility and fast delivery has passed, and most VCs have pivoted to other industries. However, we strive to focus on companies with fundamental business value in the markets not inflated by an excess of capital,\u201d Toporov said. \u201cWe believe that Whizz is a hidden gem that will continue to surprise the market.\u201d",
