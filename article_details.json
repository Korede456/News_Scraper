        "original_content": "Former Autonomy chief executive Mike Lynch issued a statement Thursday following his acquittal of criminal charges, ending a 13-year legal battle with Hewlett-Packard that became one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest fraud cases. He was accused of falsely inflating revenues at the UK startup ahead of Autonomy\u2019s $11 billion sale to HP in 2011.Commenting on the acquittal, Lynch (pictured above, left, when he appeared at TechCrunch Disrupt) said in his statement: \u201cI am elated with today\u2019s verdict and grateful to the jury for their attention to the facts over the last ten weeks. My deepest thanks go to my legal team for their tireless work on my behalf. I am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field.\u201dAfter a 12-week trial, the entrepreneur was cleared of 15 counts of fraud and conspiracy that were brought against him in relation to the 2011 acquisition.The victory for Lynch is notable in light of the fact that in the US, in fiscal year 2022, only 0.4% of federal criminal cases led to trial and acquittal, according to the Pew Research Center, and only 12% of all wire fraud prosecutions resulted in acquittal.Christopher Morvillo and Brian Heberlig, legal counsel for Lynch, added in a statement: \u201cWe are thrilled with the jury\u2019s verdict, which reflects a resounding rejection of the government\u2019s profound overreach in this case. The evidence presented at trial demonstrated conclusively that Mike Lynch is innocent. This verdict closes the book on a relentless 13-year effort to pin HP\u2019s well-documented ineptitude on Dr Lynch.\u00a0 Thankfully, the truth has finally prevailed. We thank Dr Lynch for his trust throughout this ordeal and hope that he can now return home to England to resume his life and continue innovating.\u201dLynch, 58, was previously extradited to the US, and put under house arrest and 24-hour surveillance ahead of the trial. He long maintained he was scapegoated by HP, claiming it botched the acquisition of Autonomy, and later mismanaged the company\u2019s software assets.Lynch made \u00a3500 million from the sale of Autonomy to HP. But only a year later, HP wrote down its investment by $8.8 billion, saying $5 billion of that write-down owed to practices employed by Autonomy\u2019s earlier management team that inflated Autonomy\u2019s value and misled potential buyers into believing the company was far more valuable.Prosecutors accused Lynch and Stephen Chamberlain, Autonomy\u2019s former vice president of finance, of illegally inflating revenues ahead of the acquisition and hiding high-margin software revenue inside unprofitable hardware sales.In the trial, Lynch successfully argued that he had not been involved in accounting and contract matters, instead focusing on technical and marketing issues.Although unsuccessfully arguing that the case should be heard in the UK, leading to his extradition, the US jury exonerated Lynch on all counts, along with Chamberlain, who was also on trial.The US attorney\u2019s office in San Francisco said: \u201cWe acknowledge and respect the verdict. We would like to thank the jury for its attentiveness to the evidence the government presented in this case.\u201dAutonomy\u2019s sale to HP was seen as a vindication of the UK\u2019s booming tech scene, and the platform\u2019s ability to sift through unstructured databases was, at the time, viewed as a way for HP to rebuild its flat-lining hardware business.Lynch co-founded Autonomy in 1996 out of a specialist software research group called Cambridge Neurodynamics.Awarded an OBE for services to enterprise in 2006, Lynch became a UK government adviser who sat on the boards of the BBC and the British Library, founded the Invoke Capital VC, and invested in breakout cyber security company Darktrace.",

        "original_content": "Investor demand has been so strong for shares of hot HR startup Rippling \u2013 over $2 billion worth of term sheets, it says \u2013 that it is allowing former employees to also participate in its giant, tender offer sale, the company told TechCrunch.But there is one big exception: it has banned former employees who work for a handful of competitors from selling their stock. A small group of ex employees has been trying to get the company to alter this policy, TechCrunch has learned, but so far, to no avail.Rippling has also told employees who have previously sold shares, particularly if those sales were outside its previous tender offer, that they would not be authorized to sell as many shares this time around.To recap: in April, TechCrunch broke the news thatRippling was doing a giant tender offer of up to $590 millionfor employees and existing investors, led by Coatue, along with a smaller $200 million Series F for the company. All told the deal valued HR software startup Rippling at $13.5 billion,the company said.This wasn\u2019t the first-and-only sale that let employees and longtime investors cash out of some shares, but it\u2019s by far the biggest and most profitable. Anothersmaller one took place in 2021, founder and CEO Parker Conrad told TechCrunch\u2019s GM and EIC Connie Loizos.The rules for this one, according to a summary of details seen by TechCrunch, were:the offer was open to both current and former employeesit involved options, not restricted stock units (the stock that employees had to buy, not the ones granted with restrictions as part of their comp packages)employees were eligible to sell up to 25% of their vested equity but the company was including in that count any shares they sold in the previous tender offerif an employee sold shares via any method outside of a company tender offer, the company warned it would double count those shares against the 25%former employees working for \u201ccompetitors\u201d were not eligible to participateRippling tells TechCrunch that the employees who work for the following companies are excluded: Workday, Paylocity, Gusto, Deel, Remote.com, Justworks, Hibob, Personio. Sources tell TechCrunch that employees at those companies received no information about the tender offer, but heard about their exclusion through the grapevine.None of the former employees TechCrunch spoke to were surprised to hear one name on the list: Deel. Or, according to a post on Blind, \u201cEveryone who has options is eligible, even former employees. Except if you went to Deel then you\u2019re screwed lol.\u201dWhen some former employees realized they were being excluded from the sale, a few wrote a scathing letter to Conrad and Rippling\u2019s top lawyer, Vanessa Wu, imploring Rippling to change its mind. Rippling refused to do so.Indeed there was quite a bit of internal drama involving the letter, as well as the equally scathing letters, seen by TechCrunch, that Rippling sent to some of them in response. The drama involved some people distancing themselves from the letter and many allegations of wrongdoing on both sides that TechCrunch could not independently verify. One person who was reportedly dragged into the letter drama told TechCrunch they wanted nothing more to do with any of it.Why is Rippling excluding ex-employees at competitors?The company told TechCrunch it was omitting employees at competitors because it was concerned that the sensitive information \u201cincluding detailed financial information and risk factors\u201d disclosed in the offer paperwork could wind up shared with competitors.\u201cRippling put together a tender offer for the benefit of its employees, ex-employees, and early investors. Rippling chose to be uncharacteristically broad in its approach to this tender offer (1) because Rippling wanted to be able to provide liquidity to its early employees and investors, and also, (2) because there was so much demand (received over $2B in term sheets),\u201d Rippling VP of communications Bobby Whithorne told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.\u201cHowever, tender offer rules require companies to share significant sensitive information, including private company financials, which reasonably are not materials that any company would want in the hands of its competitors. As a result, while most companies exclude former employees entirely, Rippling took the more measured approach of excluding only those former employees who currently work at a list of eight competitors with ambitions to build global HR and payroll products,\u201d Whithorne said.To be sure, as a private company, Rippling certainly has the freedom to place restrictions on participation in its stock sales.Rippling vs Deel, a competitive feud?Several sources said that Deel is a particularly touchy subject at Rippling. Both companiesplay into the rivalrywith marketingthat touts their own tech stack is betterthan the other.Rippling\u2019s hard-charging CEO Conrad is internally revered as a product genius but is also known as a competitive guy who thrives on rivalry, these sources said.He built Rippling into a $13.5 billion HR tech success with a product that tightly integrates payroll, benefits, recruiting, and a whole bunch of other services.\u00a0He also famously built a previous HR tech startup, Zenefits, into one of the fastest-growing startups of its time until it hita world of trouble that ultimately led to his ouster.Then he founded Rippling, which has also grown like dandelions under his care. During his time at Zenefits, Conrad also had avery public spat with competitor ADP.Despite the rivalry, Deel was once a customer of Rippling, though it no longer is, sources tell us.One other thing to note about excluding ex-Rippling employees working at competitors is that, it\u2019s not only about making a profit on their stock. Stock options can be costly. In addition to the price of the stock, employees may face huge tax bills on options they exercise from the paper gains of the value of the stock. Sometimes selling a portion of their stake, if they can, is a way for them to offset such tax bills.When asked about this, Rippling\u2019s Whithorne said that the company has \u201ctried to issue Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) wherever possible (all US employees) which enable employees to defer tax obligations at the time of exercise.\u201dAll employees, current or former, will be able to sell their stock one day, after a lockup period, after the company goes public. But it\u2019s not clear when Rippling will stage an offering. The company isn\u2019t likely in need of more capital at the moment. It just raised that new $200 million infusion, on top of the emergency$500 million it famously raised in 2023as part of the whole SVB crisis.For several of the people impacted by this decision, however, it\u2019s not just the money. It\u2019s also about hurt feelings that their former company believes they would do illegal or unethical things and so they are being preemptively left out of a lucrative deal.\u201cYour company doesn\u2019t love you, or value you. They are always going to do what is in their best interest. So do what\u2019s in your best interest,\u201d one source said.Got a tip about a startup culture you\u2019ve experienced?

Anothersmaller one took place in 2021, founder and CEO Parker Conrad told TechCrunch\u2019s GM and EIC Connie Loizos.The rules for this one, according to a summary of details seen by TechCrunch, were:the offer was open to both current and former employeesit involved options, not restricted stock units (the stock that employees had to buy, not the ones granted with restrictions as part of their comp packages)employees were eligible to sell up to 25% of their vested equity but the company was including in that count any shares they sold in the previous tender offerif an employee sold shares via any method outside of a company tender offer, the company warned it would double count those shares against the 25%former employees working for \u201ccompetitors\u201d were not eligible to participateRippling tells TechCrunch that the employees who work for the following companies are excluded: Workday, Paylocity, Gusto, Deel, Remote.com, Justworks, Hibob, Personio. Sources tell TechCrunch that employees at those companies received no information about the tender offer, but heard about their exclusion through the grapevine.None of the former employees TechCrunch spoke to were surprised to hear one name on the list: Deel. Or, according to a post on Blind, \u201cEveryone who has options is eligible, even former employees. Except if you went to Deel then you\u2019re screwed lol.\u201dWhen some former employees realized they were being excluded from the sale, a few wrote a scathing letter to Conrad and Rippling\u2019s top lawyer, Vanessa Wu, imploring Rippling to change its mind. Rippling refused to do so.Indeed there was quite a bit of internal drama involving the letter, as well as the equally scathing letters, seen by TechCrunch, that Rippling sent to some of them in response. The drama involved some people distancing themselves from the letter and many allegations of wrongdoing on both sides that TechCrunch could not independently verify. One person who was reportedly dragged into the letter drama told TechCrunch they wanted nothing more to do with any of it.Why is Rippling excluding ex-employees at competitors?The company told TechCrunch it was omitting employees at competitors because it was concerned that the sensitive information \u201cincluding detailed financial information and risk factors\u201d disclosed in the offer paperwork could wind up shared with competitors.\u201cRippling put together a tender offer for the benefit of its employees, ex-employees, and early investors. Rippling chose to be uncharacteristically broad in its approach to this tender offer (1) because Rippling wanted to be able to provide liquidity to its early employees and investors, and also, (2) because there was so much demand (received over $2B in term sheets),\u201d Rippling VP of communications Bobby Whithorne told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.\u201cHowever, tender offer rules require companies to share significant sensitive information, including private company financials, which reasonably are not materials that any company would want in the hands of its competitors. As a result, while most companies exclude former employees entirely, Rippling took the more measured approach of excluding only those former employees who currently work at a list of eight competitors with ambitions to build global HR and payroll products,\u201d Whithorne said.To be sure, as a private company, Rippling certainly has the freedom to place restrictions on participation in its stock sales.Rippling vs Deel, a competitive feud?Several sources said that Deel is a particularly touchy subject at Rippling. Both companiesplay into the rivalrywith marketingthat touts their own tech stack is betterthan the other.Rippling\u2019s hard-charging CEO Conrad is internally revered as a product genius but is also known as a competitive guy who thrives on rivalry, these sources said.He built Rippling into a $13.5 billion HR tech success with a product that tightly integrates payroll, benefits, recruiting, and a whole bunch of other services.\u00a0He also famously built a previous HR tech startup, Zenefits, into one of the fastest-growing startups of its time until it hita world of trouble that ultimately led to his ouster.Then he founded Rippling, which has also grown like dandelions under his care. During his time at Zenefits, Conrad also had avery public spat with competitor ADP.Despite the rivalry, Deel was once a customer of Rippling, though it no longer is, sources tell us.One other thing to note about excluding ex-Rippling employees working at competitors is that, it\u2019s not only about making a profit on their stock. Stock options can be costly. In addition to the price of the stock, employees may face huge tax bills on options they exercise from the paper gains of the value of the stock. Sometimes selling a portion of their stake, if they can, is a way for them to offset such tax bills.When asked about this, Rippling\u2019s Whithorne said that the company has \u201ctried to issue Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) wherever possible (all US employees) which enable employees to defer tax obligations at the time of exercise.\u201dAll employees, current or former, will be able to sell their stock one day, after a lockup period, after the company goes public. But it\u2019s not clear when Rippling will stage an offering. The company isn\u2019t likely in need of more capital at the moment. It just raised that new $200 million infusion, on top of the emergency$500 million it famously raised in 2023as part of the whole SVB crisis.For several of the people impacted by this decision, however, it\u2019s not just the money. It\u2019s also about hurt feelings that their former company believes they would do illegal or unethical things and so they are being preemptively left out of a lucrative deal.\u201cYour company doesn\u2019t love you, or value you. They are always going to do what is in their best interest. So do what\u2019s in your best interest,\u201d one source said.Got a tip about a startup culture you\u2019ve experienced?
