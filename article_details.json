        "content": "Temu, the super low-cost e-commerce marketplaceowned by Chinese online retailer Pinduoduo, is to face the European Union\u2019s strictest rulesafter authorities designatedthe company a \u201cvery large online platform\u201d (VLOP) under the Digital Services Act (DSA).The newscomes some two weeks afterEuropean consumer protection groups filed coordinated complaints against Temu over an alleged raft of alleged breaches relating to DSA, and a year after Temuopened its first office in the region. Temu subsequently went on topass 75 million usersin the EU, according to some reports, a figure that sits well above the EU\u2019s 45 million threshold for being classed as a VLOP.Additional scrutinyThe rules set out under the DSAhave applied since Februarywith19 separate platformsinitially subject to additional scrutiny either as a VLOP or very large online search engine (VLOSE), covering products belonging to Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, Microsoft, and Snap, among others. In December, anadditional three porn siteswere given VLOP status ahead of the official application date, while Temu\u2019s Chinese retail rivalShein was the first to be designated a VLOPafter the rules came into practice.Temu is now the 24th company to face extra obligations under the DSA, meaning the company will face extra scrutiny over its use of algorithms, AI, content rankings, recommendation tools, and suchlike, while having to assess and mitigate any \u201csystemic risks\u201d that stem from Temu\u2019s services, including addressing counterfeit, illegal or unsafe products listed on its platform.In mid-May,BEUC\u2014 the European consumer organization representing 45 consumer protection groups across the bloc \u2014 filed a formal complaint against Temu while requesting that lawmakers designate the platform as a VLOP. In tandem, more than a dozen BEUC member organizations filed complaints with their national consumer protection authorities, accusing Temu of breaching DSA.And it seems the European Commission has listened.While the additional rules that apply to VLOPs are officially binding from August for companies that have already been designated as such, Temu will have until the end of September because there is a four-month grace period to comply from the point of notification \u2014 starting today.From that point, Temu will need to work with the Commission and Irish Digital Services Coordinator \u2014 Temu\u2019s European HQ is in Dublin \u2014 to provide regular risk assessment reports, once at the start, and then on a yearly basis moving forward.\u201cTemu acknowledges the European Commission\u2019s designation of our platform as a Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) under the Digital Services Act (DSA),\u201d A Temu spokesperson said in a statement issued to TechCrunch. \u201cWe are fully committed to adhering to the rules and regulations outlined by the DSA to ensure the safety, transparency, and protection of our users within the European Union.\u201d"

        "content": "Meta has been banned from launching features on Facebook and Instagram that would have collected data on voters in Spain using the social networks ahead of next month\u2019s European Elections.The local data protection authority, the AEPD, has used emergency powers to protect local users\u2019 privacy. Meta confirmed to TechCrunch it has complied with the order, which can last for up to three months.In astatementabout the \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d, the AEPD wrote it has ordered Meta to suspend implementation of Election Day Information and Voter Information Unit features in Spain \u2014 barring \u201cthe collection and processing of data implied by their use\u201d as it puts it (the statement was translated from Spanish).The AEPD is using emergency powers contained in Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to act on local concerns. Meta\u2019s lead data protection supervisory for the GDPR is Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission but the pan-EU regulation empowers any data protection authority to act where they see urgent risks to users in their own territory.\u201cThis decision is based on exceptional circumstances, in which it is necessary to adopt measures to avoid the collection of data, the profiling of users and the transfer of information to third parties, thus preventing personal data from being used by unknown controllers and for purposes not explicit,\u201d the AEPD wrote.The Spanish DPA is concerned that Meta\u2019s planned election-related features would violate the GPDR, including in relation to the lawfulness of processing and data minimization requirements.Political views are classed as \u201cspecial category\u201d data under the pan-EU regulation \u2014 which requires a higher bar of obtaining explicit consent from the user for processing.Per the AEPD, Meta intends to process personal data including user name, IP address, age and gender and information about how the user interacts with the election-related functionalities. \u201cThe Agency considers that the collection and conservation of data planned by the company would seriously put at risk the rights and freedoms of Instagram and Facebook users, who would see an increase in the volume of information that it collects about them, allowing the creation of more complex, detailed and exhaustive profiles, generating more intrusive treatments,\u201d it wrote.\u201cMaking data that could be personal in nature available to third parties would involve a disproportionate interference in the rights and freedoms of the interested parties. This loss of control represents a high risk that these data will be used by unknown controllers and for non-explicit purposes,\u201d the authority added.Meta was contacted for a response to the AEPD\u2019s action. Spokesman Matthew Pollard sent us this statement: \u201cOur election tools have been expressly designed to respect users\u2019 privacy and comply with the GDPR. While we disagree with the AEPD\u2019s assessment in this case, we have cooperated with their request.\u201dThe Spanish DPA said Meta has been planning to launch the election related features it is blocking for all users of its services with the right to vote in the European elections except Italy, where the data protection authority already has an open procedure on this matter. We\u2019ve contacted the Garante with questions.Back in 2022, the Italian DPA also used an urgency procedure to request information from Meta related to measures it was taking around the country\u2019s general election.Meta is also under scrutiny by the European Commission in relation to its preparedness for the upcoming EU elections early next month.Back in Aprilthe Commission opened an investigation of Facebook and Instagram under the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act, saying it suspects the platforms of breaking the election integrity rules for larger platforms.Italy fires Meta urgent request for info re: election interference measures"

        "content": "Stripe, the world\u2019s most valuable fintech startup, said on Friday that it will temporarily move to an invite-only model for new account sign-ups in India, calling the move \u201ca tough decision\u201d as it navigates the country\u2019s evolving regulatory landscape.In a statementposted on its website, Stripe said businesses in India will no longer be able to sign up for new accounts through the company\u2019s website, and will instead need to request an invite. The startup, which competes with Cashfree and YC-backed Razorpay in the country, will now focus on supporting a select number of businesses, particularly those focusing on international expansion.\u201cThe regulatory landscape in India continues to evolve, and our goal is to offer the same experience in India that we aspire to offer to all our users worldwide,\u201d Stripe said in the statement. \u201cFor example, enabling all new users to launch quickly with easy onboarding is a fundamental Stripe feature that we cannot promise in India today.\u201dStripe didn\u2019t specify which regulatory change affected the firm. The Reserve Bank of India, the country\u2019s central bank, has introduced a series of stringent policy changes in the past two years that have impacted several financial services firms and startups.The change is unlikely to make a material impact to Stripe\u2019s bottom line given that the startup has limited business in India, and for that matter, many Asian markets.Stripe said it remains committed to the Indian market in the long-term and is working to build the necessary infrastructure to support more users in the country by the second half of 2025.Businesses in India that were planning to use Stripe for processing payments will need to explore alternative options in the interim. Existing users will not be impacted, Stripe said.This is a developing story. Check back for updates."
